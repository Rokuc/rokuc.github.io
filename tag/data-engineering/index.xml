      <title>An autonomous web crawler</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-background&#34;&gt;Project Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team developed a Dashboard for multiple stakeholders. While the users were happy with the dashboard, manual pipelines were time-consuming. To enhance efficiency, our team decided to create an automated crawler to directly populate a database with the same data previously stored as CSV files on sharepoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./Schema.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-outcome&#34;&gt;Project Outcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon recognizing the primary challenge, we swiftly developed and automated a crawler. We set it to run daily through the Windows Task Scheduler. However, despite preparations, the anticipated data delivery didn&amp;rsquo;t materialize as expected. This setback left stakeholders eagerly awaiting crucial insights, highlighting the pressing need for a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We successfully addressed this issue using a try-except loop. After a few hours of dedicated effort, the crawler was reinstated and resumed its consistent delivery of insights on a daily basis. Subsequently, our focus shifted to table normalization and seamless integration into our database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crawler has since operated harmoniously within our task scheduler, undergoing occasional adjustments to ensure its continued optimal performance.&lt;/p&gt;
